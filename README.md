# TripPlanner

A simple trip planner

## Goals

- create any number of trips at top level
- add places by entering names or clicking on map
- drag and drop places to rearrange order, or create hierarchies
- allow hierarchical composition of trip places so can plan high level and low level views
- see information about selected place - from Google Maps, TripAdvisor, etc.
- store notes about trips and places
- see data in tree view, grid view, or document view - editable in all three
- build neomem as a generic graph database
